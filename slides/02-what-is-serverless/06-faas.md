## Building with Serverless

- Backend-as-a-service?
- Self-assembly?

Note:
 - BaaS
   - Firebase, 1Backend, Backendless
   - Suites of services that cover most/all common needs for apps, websites
   - Particularly good for frontend-strong teams
   - But make sure you understand the security model! https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thousands-of-apps-leak-sensitive-data-via-misconfigured-firebase-backends/
 - Self-assembly
   - Need to connect other services together
   - eg transcoding video, thumbnailing, ml
   - ...so need servers?
   - thus FaaS
